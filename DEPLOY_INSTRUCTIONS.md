# How to Make Your CV Live

You can publish your Digital CV for free using **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**. Here are the two easiest ways:

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1.  **Create a Repository on GitHub**
    *   Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
    *   Name it something like `my-digital-cv`.
    *   Click **Create repository**.

2.  **Push Your Code**
    *   Copy the HTTPS URL of your new repository (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/my-digital-cv.git`).
    *   Paste that URL to me (Antigravity), and I will push the code for you.
    *   *OR* run these commands in your terminal:
        ```bash
        git remote add origin <YOUR_REPO_URL>
        git push -u origin master
        ```

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages**
    *   Go to your repository **Settings** tab on GitHub.
    *   Click **Pages** in the left sidebar.
    *   Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch**, select `master` (or `main`) and click **Save**.
    *   Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/my-digital-cv/` in a minute!

## Option 2: Netlify Drop (Easiest / No Git required)

1.  Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Drag and drop your entire `Cv` folder onto that page.
3.  Netlify will instantly host it and give you a link (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`).
4.  You can change the site name in "Site Settings".
